# Calculator
A simple calculator made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

In this project, I applied:

HTML to structure the calculator interface, using buttons for numbers and operators.
CSS to style the calculator, ensuring a clean and modern design with hover and click effects. I also used Flexbox and Grid to properly align the elements.
